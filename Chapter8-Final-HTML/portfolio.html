        <strong>Why it's special:</strong> Robby incorporates an interactive
        experience into his portfolio.<br />
        <strong>What it's about:</strong> If you associate portfolios with a dry
        list of facts, this portfolio might surprise you. Robby found a novel
        way of displayin what otherwise was dry information - he laid out his
        portfolio site as a video game that the visitor can acutally play. This
        incredibly fun interactive design portfolio will make you scroll.
